# Spec Authoring Guide

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Updated:** 2026-03-30  
**Status:** Active  
**AI Confidence:** Production-Ready  
**Ambiguity:** None

---

## Overview

This is the **definitive guide** for any AI agent or human contributor to understand, navigate, create, and maintain specifications in this repository. It covers folder structure, naming conventions, required files, templates, cross-referencing, scoring metrics, reliability validation, and the `.lovable/` institutional memory system — everything needed to produce spec-compliant documentation from scratch.

### How to Write an Overview (`00-overview.md`)

Every module's `00-overview.md` must follow this structure:

1. **Title** — H1 heading matching the module name
2. **Metadata block** — Version, Updated date, Status, AI Confidence Score (0–100%), Ambiguity Score (0–100%)
3. **Overview paragraph** — 1–2 paragraphs explaining what the module covers, its purpose, and who benefits
4. **Scoring section** — AI Confidence Score, Ambiguity Score, and Health Score with thresholds
5. **Keywords section** — Searchable tags for AI discovery
6. **Files table** — Numbered inventory of all files with links and descriptions
7. **Cross-References table** — Links to related modules, memories, and external docs

> **Rule:** The overview is the **entry point**. An AI agent reading only the overview should understand the module's scope, readiness, and how to find any file within it.

---

## Scoring Metrics

Every `00-overview.md` MUST include these three scores:

### AI Confidence

Measures how ready the specification is for an AI agent to implement the described feature.

| Tier | Icon | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Production-Ready** | ✅ | Specs are complete, unambiguous, and fully implementable | All interfaces defined, acceptance criteria explicit, error codes mapped |
| **High** | 🟢 | Minor gaps exist but AI can proceed with reasonable assumptions | Most sections complete; a few edge cases undefined |
| **Medium** | 🟡 | Significant gaps; AI will need clarification or make risky assumptions | Missing types, partial acceptance criteria, unclear validation rules |
| **Low** | 🔴 | Major sections missing; do NOT attempt implementation | No interfaces, no acceptance criteria, vague requirements |

**Factors that increase confidence:** Complete interfaces, explicit acceptance criteria, error code mappings, clear data models, defined API contracts.

**Factors that decrease confidence:** Missing types, vague requirements ("should handle errors"), undefined edge cases, no acceptance criteria.

### Ambiguity

Measures how much interpretation is required. **Lower tiers are better.**

| Tier | Icon | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| **None** | ✅ | No interpretation needed; every detail is explicit | All fields typed, all flows documented, all errors handled |
| **Low** | 🟢 | A few areas need assumptions; acceptable for implementation | Minor gaps in edge cases or optional features |
| **Medium** | 🟡 | Multiple areas require interpretation; review recommended | Several undefined behaviors, partial validation rules |
| **High** | 🟠 | Many areas open to interpretation; rewrite recommended | Missing data models, unclear permissions, vague UI specs |
| **Critical** | 🔴 | Spec is too vague to implement; MUST be rewritten | No clear structure, contradictory requirements, missing core definitions |

**Common ambiguity sources:** Undefined field types, unclear validation rules, missing error handling paths, unspecified permissions, vague UI requirements.

### Health Score (0–100)

Structural compliance score calculated by the dashboard scanner:

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| `00-overview.md` present | 25% |
| `99-consistency-report.md` present | 25% |
| Lowercase kebab-case naming | 25% |
| Unique numeric sequence prefixes | 25% |

**100/100 = A+** — All four criteria met.

## File Categories

Every spec file falls into one of these categories. When creating a new file, assign it the correct category to help AI agents and contributors navigate:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Overview** | Module entry point with metadata and file index | `00-overview.md` |
| **Architecture** | System design, data flow, component structure | `01-architecture.md`, `02-data-model.md` |
| **API / Interface** | Endpoints, contracts, request/response schemas | `03-api-design.md`, `04-rest-endpoints.md` |
| **Logic / Rules** | Business logic, validation rules, algorithms | `05-validation-rules.md`, `06-scoring-logic.md` |
| **UI / Frontend** | Component specs, layouts, user flows | `07-ui-components.md`, `08-user-flows.md` |
| **Backend** | Server-side implementation, database, services | `09-database-schema.md`, `10-service-layer.md` |
| **Diagrams** | Mermaid diagrams, architecture visuals, flow charts | `11-diagrams.md`, `12-sequence-diagrams.md` |
| **Testing** | Test plans, acceptance criteria, QA standards | `97-acceptance-criteria.md` |
| **Meta / Reports** | Consistency reports, changelogs, migration notes | `99-consistency-report.md`, `98-changelog.md` |

> **Rule:** Assign a category in the file's metadata block so AI agents can filter and prioritize what to read.

## Folder Structure Examples

### Standard Module (Flat)

```
spec/17-research-queries/
├── 00-overview.md
├── 01-query-types.md
├── 02-search-algorithms.md
├── 97-acceptance-criteria.md
└── 99-consistency-report.md
```

### CLI Tool Module (3-Folder Pattern)

```
spec/20-gsearch-cli/
├── 00-overview.md
├── 01-backend/
│   ├── 01-architecture.md
│   ├── 02-commands.md
│   └── 03-api-design.md
├── 02-frontend/
│   ├── 01-ui-components.md
│   └── 02-user-flows.md
├── 03-diagrams/
│   └── 01-architecture-diagram.md
├── 97-acceptance-criteria.md
└── 99-consistency-report.md
```

### WordPress Plugin Module (Multi-Layer)

A WP plugin spec may include admin, public-facing frontend, backend logic, and diagrams:

```
spec/28-wp-starter-plugin/
├── 00-overview.md
├── 01-backend/
│   ├── 01-architecture.md
│   ├── 02-database-schema.md
│   ├── 03-rest-api.md
│   ├── 04-hooks-and-filters.md
│   └── 05-cron-jobs.md
├── 02-admin/
│   ├── 01-admin-dashboard.md
│   ├── 02-settings-page.md
│   └── 03-admin-notices.md
├── 03-frontend/
│   ├── 01-shortcodes.md
│   ├── 02-gutenberg-blocks.md
│   └── 03-public-assets.md
├── 04-diagrams/
│   ├── 01-architecture-diagram.md
│   └── 02-data-flow-diagram.md
├── 97-acceptance-criteria.md
└── 99-consistency-report.md
```

> **Key insight:** WP plugins naturally split into `admin/` (dashboard UI), `frontend/` (public-facing), `backend/` (PHP logic, REST, hooks), and `diagrams/`. AI agents should follow this pattern when creating WordPress plugin specs.

---

## File Naming Convention (Quick Reference)

All files and folders in `spec/` and `.lovable/` MUST use **lowercase kebab-case**:

```
✅ 01-backend/                   ✅ 00-overview.md
✅ 20-gsearch-cli/               ✅ 03-api-design.md
✅ .lovable/memories/workflow/   ✅ file-naming-conventions.md

❌ 01-Backend/                   ❌ ApiDesign.md
❌ 09_gsearch_cli/               ❌ file_naming.md
```

**Numeric prefixes** are mandatory for spec files/folders and optional for memory files. See [02-naming-conventions.md](./02-naming-conventions.md) for full rules.

---

## Cross-Reference Validation Checklist

Every spec file must pass these cross-reference checks:

| # | Check | Rule |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | **Relative paths only** | Never use root-relative (`/spec/...`) or absolute filesystem paths |
| 2 | **File extension included** | Always end with `.md` — never bare paths |
| 3 | **Target exists** | Every linked file must exist on disk |
| 4 | **Lowercase paths** | Path segments must be entirely lowercase kebab-case |
| 5 | **Depth correctness** | Count `../` levels carefully from source to target |
| 6 | **Bidirectional linking** | If module A references module B, module B should reference A |
| 7 | **Post-rename audit** | After any module renumbering, grep and update ALL references |

**Automated validation:** Run `node scripts/generate-dashboard-data.cjs` — the output JSON reports all broken links. Zero broken links = passing.

See [07-cross-references.md](./07-cross-references.md) for full syntax and examples.

---

## Reliability Check Report

Every module SHOULD include a **reliability risk assessment** to evaluate implementation feasibility before coding begins. These reports are stored in `spec/validation-reports/` or inline within the module.

### What It Covers

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Complexity Tier** | Simple / Medium / Complex Agentic / End-to-End |
| **Success Probability** | Estimated % chance of first-pass implementation success |
| **Failure Modes** | Where, why, and how failures can manifest |
| **Risk Mitigations** | Specific actions to reduce failure likelihood |
| **Dependency Risks** | External APIs, shared modules, or integrations that add risk |

### When to Create

- Before implementing any **Complex Agentic** or **End-to-End** module
- When a module's AI Confidence Score is below 70%
- When multiple modules have interdependencies
- After a major spec rewrite or architectural change

---

## The `.lovable/` Folder

The `.lovable/` directory is the **institutional knowledge hub** for the project. It persists AI-learned patterns, decisions, and workflows across sessions.

### Canonical Structure

```

```

### Task & Issue Tracking Folders

The memory folder includes dedicated folders for tracking work items:

| Folder | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `pending/` | Tasks currently in progress or awaiting action | Active work items, blocked tasks |
| `planned/` | Tasks queued for future execution | Upcoming batches, prioritized backlog |
| `done/` | Completed tasks archive | Finished work items (move from pending/planned) |
| `completed-issues/` | Resolved issues archive | Bug fixes, resolved problems, closed issues |

> **Workflow:** Create task files in `planned/` → move to `pending/` when work starts → move to `done/` when complete. Issues follow the same flow but end in `completed-issues/`.

### Consolidation Rule

> **There is only ONE memory folder: `.lovable/memories/`.** The legacy `.lovable/memory/` variant is prohibited. If found during audits, migrate all contents to `.lovable/memories/` and delete the legacy folder.

### Memory File Conventions

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Naming** | Lowercase kebab-case; numeric prefixes optional (unlike spec files) |
| **Format** | Every file: H1 title → metadata (Updated, Version, Status) → Overview → Content → Cross-References |
| **Index** | Always update `00-memory-index.md` when adding/removing files |
| **Depth** | Maximum 2 levels: `memories/{category}/{file}.md` |
| **No duplication** | Don't duplicate information already in spec files |

### What Goes in Memories vs. Specs

| Content | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Formal specifications, APIs, data models | `spec/` |
| Architectural decisions, conventions, patterns | `.lovable/memories/` |
| Execution plans and batch tracking | `.lovable/plan.md` |
| Suggestion tracking | `.lovable/memories/suggestions/` |
| Pending / planned / done tasks | `.lovable/memories/pending/`, `planned/`, `done/` |
| Completed issues | `.lovable/memories/completed-issues/` |
| Reliability assessments | `.lovable/memories/reports/` or `spec/validation-reports/` |

### Where AI Should Write Updates

When an AI agent learns something new or the user provides instructions:

| User Says | AI Writes To |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Remember this pattern" | `.lovable/memories/patterns/` or relevant category |
| "Add this to the plan" | `.lovable/plan.md` |
| "Track this task" | `.lovable/memories/planned/` or `pending/` |
| "This issue is resolved" | Move to `.lovable/memories/completed-issues/` |
| "Update coding guidelines" | `.lovable/memories/constraints/` |
| "Add WP plugin spec" | `spec/XX-wp-plugin-name/` (spec tree) |
| "Remember WP plugin convention" | `.lovable/memories/wp-plugins/` |

See [06-memory-folder-guide.md](./06-memory-folder-guide.md) for the complete memory folder guide.
